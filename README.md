# Files

The files module allows you to upload multiple files thanks to [DropzoneJS](http://www.dropzonejs.com).  
Image thumbnails are generated on the fly with [Croppa](https://github.com/BKWLD/croppa).

This module is part of [TypiCMS](https://github.com/TypiCMS/Base), a multilingual CMS based on Laravel 5.
